Hello there ! Welcome to my page 😁

I am currently a Masters Student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I believe code/tech to be a form of creative expression, crafting solutions that solve real world problems of both mine and yours : ) Constantly trying to get better at my art and aim to leave behind a few masterpieces.

I have always been curious about how our brain learns and adapts. This curiosity drives my research interest to be in reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms and more recently in AI interpretability, where I try to explore different ways to make AI more efficient, effective and explainable. 

In my spare time, i  enjoy playing sports (mostly squash, badminton and tennis), explore hiking trails and occasional binge on some anime.

I am always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate and work on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to say hi!
