### Introduction 
Naturally the first question that would come to your mind is <b> Why should I learn about Object Oriented Programming ? Why should I break my head around learning what are Classes and Objects ? </b>. Let me illustrate the benefits of OOPs with a few examples: 

- Imagine you are a Game Developer xyz

- Imagine you are a Data Scientist xyz

- Imagine you are a Software Developer xyz

>Allow us to group data and functions elaborate when you see certain patterns / structure or blue print (ELABORATE On This)

I hope now you have the motivation to learn more about <b>OOPs</b>. Learning these concepts help's you develop elegant solutions to is to problems.

### Practical Object Oriented Programming in Python 
The below jupyter notebook goes through the concepts of OOPs one by one with both explaination and code. 

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/OOPS.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
